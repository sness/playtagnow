	<h3>
	  To start the music, click in a grid square.
	  </h3>
	<h3>
	  Clicking on different parts of the grid will play different
	  songs.
	</h3>
	<br /><br />
	<p>
	  The different genres have all been given different colours,
	  yellow for classical, green for reggae, purple for rock.  The
	  size of the label shows how many songs are in that category.
	  The label is placed in the center of where it's songs are on the
	  map, for example most of the classical songs are in the lower
	  left part of the map, so the classical label is in that corner.
	  The blues songs are spread all over the map, so the blues label
	  is near the middle of the map.

	  MarGrid is a music collection visualization interface. It
	  utilizes feature extraction and a self-organized map to map each
	  song in a collection to a square in a grid of cells.
	  </p>
	<p>
	  Once the self-organized map has been trained it can be used to predict
	  grid positions for new songs.

 margridflash is built using technology that is part of the <a href="http://marsyas.sness.net">Marsyas</a> audio framework.
